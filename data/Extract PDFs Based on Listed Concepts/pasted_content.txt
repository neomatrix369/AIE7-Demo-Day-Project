I want to understand the following idea better and how to go about using, fine tuning, etc. especially gpt-oss:20b and gpt-oss:120b. Go deep and understand these two models and the following context.

Let's really understand deeply first. Don't go into any implementation yet, let's fully understand the idea at a high level first. Just the concepts at this point.

Local Model System with Intelligent Routing, MOE, and Tool Calling

  Based on the conversation transcript, here's the architectural vision being discussed:

  Core Concept: Multi-Layer Intelligence System

  The discussion reveals a sophisticated 3-layer architecture for local AI systems:

  1. MOE Layer (Mixture of Experts) - The base model intelligence that automatically routes to specialized experts based on query complexity
  2. Router Layer - A meta-layer that decides when the local model has reached its limits and needs to escalate to larger models
  3. Tool Use Layer - Separate engineering for enabling models to interact with external tools and APIs

  Key Insights from the Conversation:

  1. Local Model Self-Awareness & Escalation

  - Local models (like GPT-20B mentioned) should recognize their own limitations
  - When a query exceeds local capability, the model automatically escalates to cloud APIs (GPT-5 level models)
  - This creates a tiered intelligence system where simple queries stay local, complex ones go to the cloud

  2. Query Filtering & Optimization

  The most fascinating idea: "Super dense models that only accept queries from other models"
  - Local models act as intelligent filters, ensuring only novel/complex questions reach expensive cloud models
  - This eliminates "dumb prompts" wasting compute on powerful models
  - Local models guarantee questions are "near novel" before escalation

  3. Tool Calling Intelligence

  The discussion highlights how modern models (specifically mentioning the 20B model):
  - Are "really well trained to figure out how to use tools"
  - Can use tools in creative and different ways each time
  - Don't need explicit instruction on which tool to use - they automatically understand context

  4. Engineering Implementation Strategy

  Key quote: "We can get a really good model to figure out how to figure this out"
  - Use AI models themselves to design the routing system
  - Models can create fine-tuning datasets for local routing decisions
  - The system can be self-improving through model-guided architecture

  Practical Architecture Vision:

  User Query → Local Model (20B GPT-like)
                ↓
          [Complexity Assessment]
                ↓
      Simple → Process Locally with Tools
                ↓
      Complex → Router Decision
                ↓
           [MOE Expert Selection]
                ↓
      Still Limited? → Cloud API (GPT-5+)
                ↓
           [Response Synthesis]

  Implementation Ideas Discussed:

  1. Local Independence: Running web search servers locally for unlimited searches vs relying on APIs like Tavily
  2. Fine-tuning Capability: Using local GPUs to fine-tune models for specific routing decisions
  3. Hybrid Approach: Not purely local - strategic API calls to bigger models when needed
  4. Training Data Generation: Having cloud models generate training data for local model improvements

  The "GPT-5 Level" Architecture Theory:

  The conversation suggests OpenAI at GPT-5 level implements:
  - MOE layer for expert selection
  - Router layer for model selection
  - Tool use as a separate engineering effort
  - These are "distinct engineering efforts" but abstractly serve the same purpose: allowing models to exceed their fixed domain

  Business/Practical Application:

  The speaker wants to rebuild the "O3 ChatGPT experience" locally:
  - Full tool calling capability
  - Web search integration
  - Intelligent escalation to cloud when needed
  - Cost-effective for "boring business stuff"

  The vision is essentially creating a hierarchical AI system where local models serve as intelligent gatekeepers and processors, only escalating to expensive cloud resources
   when genuinely needed, while maintaining full tool-calling capabilities throughout the stack.

Awesome—let’s get crisp on the concepts first, with the two gpt-oss models in mind, and then map them to your 3-layer vision (MOE layer → router layer → tool-use layer). No implementation yet—just how the pieces think and fit.

What gpt-oss:20b & gpt-oss:120b are (conceptually)
Open-weight reasoning models released under Apache-2.0. They’re text-only, designed for agentic work (tools, structured outputs), and expose full chain-of-thought (for debugging/monitoring—not for end-users). 
OpenAI
+1

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformers. Internally, each layer contains a pool of experts; a learned router (inside the model) selects a small subset per token (“top-k”) so only a fraction of parameters fire each step. gpt-oss-120b has 128 experts/layer (4 active), 36 layers; gpt-oss-20b has 32 experts/layer (4 active), 24 layers. That’s ~5.1B vs 3.6B active params/token respectively—why they feel larger than their deploy cost. 
OpenAI

Attention & context. Alternating dense + banded-window attention, RoPE positions, grouped MQA; native context ≈128k (131,072) tokens. 
OpenAI

Post-training for agentic behavior. They’re trained to reason (CoT) and to use tools (browse, run code, call developer functions). Reasoning effort is adjustable (low/medium/high) to trade speed for depth. 
OpenAI

Harmony chat format. A role/channel scheme (System, Developer, User, Assistant, Tool) with channels like analysis (CoT), commentary (function calls), final (user output). It’s important conceptually because it cleanly separates thinking, acting, and answering. 
OpenAI

Quantization & footprint. Most MoE weights ship quantized (MXFP4), letting 120b run in ~80 GB and 20b in ~16 GB memory envelopes—shaping where each sits in a tiered system. 
OpenAI
OpenAI

Knowledge profile. Text-only pretraining with heavy STEM/coding focus; knowledge cutoff June 2024, hence a strong conceptual need for browsing/tools. 
OpenAI

How this maps to your 3-layer vision
1) MOE layer (in-model expert selection).
This is inside each gpt-oss model: per-token expert routing specializes computation (e.g., code/math/text experts). Think of it as “micro-routing” that gives you large-model behavior at smaller active compute. It’s automatic and learned; you don’t script it. 
OpenAI

2) Router layer (system-level model selection).
This is your external meta-controller deciding: “Do we stay on 20b, escalate to 120b, or go to a cloud frontier model?” It’s separate from MoE. Conceptually it uses signals (uncertainty, task type, novelty, safety risk, cost/latency budgets) to choose the tier.

3) Tool-use layer (act in the world).
This is your orchestration plane. The model already learned how to call tools; your layer defines what tools exist (web, Python, proprietary APIs), governs when calls are allowed, captures traces, and enforces safety/policy. The Harmony channels make this clean: analysis → decide; commentary → call; final → answer. 
OpenAI
+1

Roles for 20b vs 120b in a local tiered system
20b as the “always-on edge brain.” Fastest, lowest cost, surprisingly competitive on reasoning; ideal for first pass, summarization, routine tool use, novelty filtering, and creating draft CoT/tool plans. 
OpenAI

120b as the “local heavy thinker.” Larger expert pool and deeper stack for multi-hop reasoning, tougher coding/math, or safety-sensitive synthesis—still local/private. It often approaches o4-mini on core evals. 
OpenAI

Cloud (GPT-5+ tier) as the “frontier escalator.” Reserved for genuinely novel/hard or high-stakes queries, or where newest knowledge is required beyond 2024—and where you accept external calls.

What the Router should conceptually look at
(Signals, not algorithms yet)

Uncertainty & struggle: entropy of next-token distribution; self-rated confidence; “hedging” in analysis; long, looping CoT without progress.

Task taxonomy: coding with failing tests; formal math; policy/safety-sensitive topics; high-recall Q&A vs creative drafting.

Novelty & redundancy: embedding-based similarity to past Q/A; cache hits; “is this new enough to merit escalation?” (your “super-dense, model-only inbox” idea).

Tool necessity: needs browsing beyond cutoff, code execution, or private APIs. The presence/absence of successful tool traces is a go/no-go signal. 
OpenAI

Cost/latency/SLA budgets: user or workflow constraints can hard-gate tiers.

Safety posture: raise tier if content risks are detected, so the stronger policy model/tooling gets applied (and log everything). 
OpenAI

Tool-calling intelligence (conceptual)
gpt-oss models already “think with tools” (browse, Python, developer functions) and can interleave CoT with calls. Your tool layer decides capabilities, limits, and audit. This separation lets the same query flow through 20b → 120b → cloud, with consistent tool semantics and clean traces for learning. 
OpenAI

The Harmony format means traces are first-class: perfect for observability and building self-improving datasets (router labels, tool-use demonstrations, correction pairs). 
OpenAI

Fine-tuning levers (what to teach, not how)
Router judgment: SFT a small schema like “ROUTE = {local20b, local120b, cloud}; REASON = …; TOOLS = […]”. Use high-quality traces from production and from a cloud teacher to teach when to escalate and what to call.

Tool selection/discipline: Demonstrations where tools clearly help vs hurt; reward short, purposeful tool plans; penalize thrash. The Harmony commentary/final split makes the objective legible. 
OpenAI

Domain adaptation: Feed your domain’s docs, APIs, and evaluation prompts so 20b does more locally; 120b becomes your local specialist; cloud is rare.

Safety alignment in the open: Because these are open-weights, apply additional guardrails appropriate to your use case (filters, content policy SFT, or post-processors), since you don’t inherit the full system-level defenses of hosted models. 
OpenAI

Operating principles & mental models
Micro vs macro routing. MoE ≈ in-model micro-routing; your router ≈ cross-model macro-routing. They’re complementary: MoE makes each tier efficient; the router moves between tiers. 
OpenAI

Reasoning-effort as a dial. Before escalating models, try turning the model’s internal “effort” (low→medium→high); accuracy often improves smoothly with longer CoT (known test-time scaling). 
OpenAI

Traces are the fuel. Harmony channels + tool logs give you labeled data for continuous improvement (router, tool-choice, refusals). 
OpenAI

Use tools to beat the cutoff. Browsing/python aren’t bolt-ons; they’re core to keeping local models current and factual. 
OpenAI

If this framing clicks, next we can design the evaluation rubric (what “good routing” means), the data you need to teach it, and only then the implementation path (serving, telemetry, and fine-tuning mechanics).

Ok, i think this captures the high level, what I want to understand is for the next level of understanding, can we collect the model cards and other information about all the relevant models so we can go deep into what models will be able to do and when we need to use a better model and what model would be best. There are many great options, but the frontier is  (attached)

how can we build a really good dataset that we can start in e.g. PDFs, etc. to start with and I'll use some tools locally to create the RAG to go deep on them before we go deeper into the design. What we really want to answer is, if we can teach the model to realize it needs to use another model, it has the best information available about what model to use. And as we know the frontier WILL 100% change and publicly available information will also change and so we want a complete system including playwright browser stuff to feed new data over time

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 50s
Perfect—this is the right moment to design the knowledge base your router will consult. Below is a concrete but implementation-agnostic plan for (1) what to collect, (2) how to store it (PDFs + structured), (3) how to keep it fresh with a Playwright crawler, and (4) how the router will use it to decide when/which model to escalate to—all before we write a line of code.

1) What to collect (capability ontology)
Think of each model’s “card” as two layers:

A. Canonical fields (machine-readable)

identity: provider, model_id, release_date, version/patch, family (dense/MoE), license (open/closed), local/hosted availability

modalities: text | vision | audio | tool-calling support; JSON-mode availability; function calling schema support

context & I/O: native context window, recommended max output, system prompt limits, tokenizer family

reasoning/agent flags: supports tool-use plans, self-critique / reflection knobs, reasoning-effort controls, multi-turn memory notes

evals (normalized): GPQA, HLE, MMLU(Pro), Code (HumanEval+, SWE-bench, LiveCodeBench), Math (GSM8K, AIME), Vision (MMMU, OCR), Safety (harmless/helpful), Robustness.

Include source, date, prompt style, and notes (to avoid apples-to-oranges).

cost/latency: price per input/output token (if API), typical latency percentiles (P50/P95) by context size; local VRAM/RAM footprints by quantization (if open-weights)

limits & quotas: rate limits, concurrent requests, batch generation support

tooling ecosystem: official SDKs, server compatibility (vLLM/llama.cpp/etc.), supported function-calling conventions

strengths/weaknesses (curated): short bullets per task type (coding, math, structured JSON, safety-sensitive content, long-context retrieval…)

changelog: dated diffs with highlights + links

sources: official card URLs, blog posts, provider docs, 3rd-party eval pages (for auditability)

trust scores: (0–1) per fact if scraped vs from official docs vs benchmark repo; who added it; when last verified

B. Long-form narrative (human-readable)

A 1–2 page write-up per model: positioning, intended uses, “gotchas,” and exemplar prompts.

This is what you’ll preserve as a PDF for RAG reading.

2) Storage design (structured + PDFs)
Use one folder per model with both structured metadata and artifact snapshots.

Tip: keep the YAML as the primary artifact; (re)generate the pretty PDF from it so your PDF always matches the structured truth.

3) Curation scope (initial seed list)
Include both frontier closed and open-weights that are likely candidates for routing:

OpenAI: GPT-5 family, o3/o4-mini for reference, gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b

xAI: Grok 4 / latest

Anthropic: Claude 3.x/3.7 (or successor)

Google: Gemini 2.5 Pro / Flash / Code (latest revs)

Meta: Llama 4.x (chat/code variants)

DeepSeek: R1-* series (reasoning)

Alibaba/Qwen: Qwen-2.5 / QwQ reasoning line

Mistral: Large / Codestral (latest)

Cohere: command-family (for structured JSON, enterprise)

Also snapshot third-party evaluators (e.g., LifeArchitect models table, Chatbot Arena/LMSYS, HELM v2) as secondary signals, with lower trust weight.

4) Playwright ingestion & refresh (conceptual)
Ingestion phases (per seed URL):

Fetch & render: Playwright → save HTML (raw), PDF (print), MHTML (optional).

Normalize text: strip nav/ads, keep tables; store cleaned.md + cleaned.txt.

Extract fields: rule-based parsers first (CSS/XPath for common patterns), then LLM-aided fallback to populate model.card.yaml.

Every extracted fact gets (value, evidence URL, confidence, timestamp).

Hashing & change detection: SHA256 of normalized text + ETag/Last-Modified when available.

Diff & changelog: if hash changes, create a dated snapshot in /sources/ and append to changelog.md.

Quality gates: reject updates that lower confidence or contradict higher-trust sources without human review.

Scheduler (evergreen updates):

Cadence: daily for official provider pages; weekly for third-party evals.

QDF: raise cadence temporarily after major releases (you can detect spikes via RSS / newsroom pages).

Robots & ethics: obey robots.txt; set polite delays; rotate user agents responsibly.

5) Packaging for RAG (before any implementation)
Chunking strategy

Chunk structured fields separately from narrative; store short “fact cards” so retrieval can answer questions like “Which models support JSON mode with ≥128k context?” without reading prose.

Chunk tables (evals, pricing) row-wise with the header repeated to preserve column semantics.

Keep source IDs in chunk metadata so the router can cite.

Index views (multiple):

facts_index (from YAML → canonical facts as mini-sentences)

narrative_index (from PDFs/MD prose)

evals_index (from CSV/JSON tables, normalized to a common schema)

changelog_index (diff snippets for “what changed recently?”)

Reranking

Use a light cross-encoder (or hybrid sparse+dense) so queries like “hard math with step-limit” pull in reasoning-strength and long-context facts—not just name matches.

6) How the router uses the KB (conceptually)
Your router shouldn’t memorize providers—it should query the KB to propose a route.

Task features (signals computed from the user request and context):

input length & expected output length

modalities needed (vision, audio)

need for tools (browse/code/db)

domain (coding/math/law/creative)

freshness requirement (post-cutoff knowledge?)

privacy/safety sensitivity

latency/cost budget

“struggle signals” from the current model (low confidence, repeated loops, failing tests)

Route Plan (JSON)

{
  "route_decision": {
    "tier": "local" ,               // local20b | local120b | cloud
    "model": "openai.gpt-oss-20b",
    "reason": "short text, needs tool-calling and JSON mode, no freshness risk",
    "tool_plan": ["browser.search", "python.exec"],
    "fallbacks": [
      {
        "if": "uncertainty>0.35 OR tool_plan fails twice",
        "then_model": "openai.gpt-oss-120b",
        "reason": "higher reasoning depth"
      },
      {
        "if": "freshness_required OR evals indicate weakness_in_domain",
        "then_model": "openai.gpt-5",
        "reason": "post-2024 knowledge & top-tier coding"
      }
    ],
    "kb_citations": [
      {"model":"openai.gpt-oss-20b","facts":["tool_calling","context_window","evals.code.human_eval_plus"]},
      {"model":"openai.gpt-5","facts":["pricing","rate_limits"]}
    ]
  }
}
Scoring function (conceptual)

For each candidate model, compute a fit score from KB facts:
fit = w_task * task_match + w_eval * normalized_eval + w_tool * tool_support + w_cost * cost_match + w_latency * latency_match + w_policy * safety_fit

Choose argmax, with constraints (e.g., must_have: JSON mode, context ≥ N).

7) Keeping “frontier will change” under control
Version every fact (who/when/source) and preserve old PDFs.

Maintain confidence per field and trust precedence: official docs > official posts > provider staff posts > reputable aggregators > social.

Build a “Recently Changed” view for the router: it can boost freshness when a model just got a big upgrade (e.g., new context window).

Add a light anomaly detector to flag suspicious swings in external leaderboards before they influence routes.

8) Starter templates (drop-in)

Page 1: Model summary (identity, modalities, context, top evals, “when to use”)

Page 2–3: Strengths/weaknesses, cost/latency charts, tool ecosystem, “known pitfalls”

Appendix: Full evals table + changelog highlights

9) Quality & governance
Licensing: store license text and usage constraints alongside the card; tag export-restricted models.

Reproducibility: keep the exact rendered HTML/PDF of sources per snapshot to defend decisions.

PII & safety: exclude user data from cards; cards are public facts only.

Attribution: every fact in YAML has an evidence URL and last_verified date.

10) What this unlocks (before we build)
You’ll be able to RAG-feed the router with current, auditable facts for “should I escalate?” decisions.

As models evolve, Playwright snapshots keep the KB fresh; your router’s decisions become explainable (“we chose Model X because JSON mode + 128k context + best code evals last verified yesterday”).

The same KB will drive analytics (e.g., “how many queries escalated due to freshness?”) and fine-tuning datasets for a learned router later.

If you want, I can turn the schema + folder layout above into a ready-to-fill starter pack (empty YAMLs and a sample PDF template) so you can begin populating the cards for gpt-oss-20b/120b, GPT-5, Grok-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and DeepSeek.
