# Gap Analysis Dashboard & Recommendations Engine

**Enhanced Implementation Complete - August 2024**

## üéØ Overview

The Gap Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive feature that provides intelligent content gap detection and prioritized actionable recommendations for corpus improvement. Now fully domain-agnostic with practical improvement strategies, it works with any dataset and includes role-specific recommendations with rich text formatting support.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### üìä Gap Analysis Dashboard
- **Interactive Overview Cards**: Real-time statistics showing gaps, critical issues, and improvement potential
- **Topic-based Gap Detection**: Identifies developing coverage areas with expandable details
- **Visual Severity Indicators**: Color-coded priority levels and impact assessment
- **Uncovered Topics Display**: Visual tags showing missing content areas

### üí° Advanced Recommendations Engine  
- **Priority Scoring System**: Advanced `impact * (1/effort)` calculation with category-based sorting
- **Practical Improvement Strategies**: Role-specific strategies (Developer, Support, Admin, Customer) with actionable approaches
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Markdown bold formatting support using `**text**` syntax rendered as HTML
- **Content Generation Methods**: Internal knowledge mining, external research, and LLM-generated content strategies
- **Implementation Workflow**: Mark-as-implemented and dismissal functionality with tracking

### üß† Domain-Agnostic Intelligence
- **Universal System**: Works with any dataset without hardcoded domain patterns or topic categories
- **Dynamic Role Detection**: Uses role_name or source fields for automatic categorization
- **Gap Type Classification**: Coverage, quality, and retrieval gap identification across any domain
- **Dynamic Priority Scoring**: High/Medium/Low recommendations based on impact and effort
- **Generic Analytics**: Gap percentages, improvement potential, and summary statistics for any content type

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- **`GapAnalysisService`**: Core rule-based gap detection engine
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/analysis/gaps` with comprehensive analysis
- **Topic Pattern Matching**: Keyword-based topic classification
- **Priority Algorithms**: Dynamic effort estimation and impact calculation

### Frontend Components
- **`GapAnalysisDashboard`**: Main container with data loading
- **`GapAnalysisOverview`**: Statistics cards with visual indicators
- **`DevelopingCoverageAreas`**: Topic visualization with expandable details for developing coverage areas
- **`RecommendationCards`**: Interactive recommendation display

### Integration
- **Experiment Tab**: Collapsible section with "NEW" badge
- **Real-time Data**: Uses existing `usePageData` pattern
- **Theme Consistency**: Matches current design system
- **TypeScript Support**: Complete type definitions

## üß™ Verified Functionality

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Backend API responding with structured gap analysis
- ‚úÖ Rule-based detection identifying content gaps (scores < 5.0)
- ‚úÖ Topic classification detecting "Payment" and "Default" uncovered areas
- ‚úÖ Priority scoring generating 4 High-priority recommendations
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration with interactive dashboard
- ‚úÖ Test data: 4 gaps found with 100% gap percentage and 5.2 improvement potential
