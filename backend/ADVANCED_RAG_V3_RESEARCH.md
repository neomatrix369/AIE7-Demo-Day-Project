## ðŸ”¬ Research Areas Needed for Next-Level RAG

### 1. **Learned Retrieval Models**
**Current Limitation:** We're using fixed embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)

**Research Needed:**
- Fine-tuned retrieval models (ColBERT, SPLADE, DPR)
- Domain-adaptive pre-training on AI model documentation
- Contrastive learning from user feedback

**Papers to Review:**
- "ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction" (2024)
- "SPLADE v3: Learned Sparse Retrieval with Expansion" (2024)
- "Domain-Adaptive Dense Retrieval" (2025)

**Expected Improvement:** +25-30% over current embeddings

---

### 2. **Neural Reranking with Cross-Encoders**
**Current Limitation:** Our reranking is rule-based with simple scoring

**Research Needed:**
- Pre-trained cross-encoder models (ms-marco-MiniLM, Cohere Rerank)
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific relevance judgments
- Listwise ranking approaches

**Papers to Review:**
- "Efficient Cross-Encoder Reranking at Scale" (2024)
- "RankGPT: LLMs as Ranking Agents" (2025)
- "Listwise Reranking with Transformers" (2024)

**Implementation Options:**
```python
# Option 1: Use pre-trained cross-encoder
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')

# Option 2: Use Cohere Rerank API
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(api_key)
reranked = co.rerank(query, documents, model='rerank-english-v2.0')

# Option 3: Use LLM for reranking (expensive but powerful)
rankings = gpt4.rank_documents(query, documents)
```

**Expected Improvement:** +20-25% reranking accuracy

---

### 3. **Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)**
**Current Limitation:** We search with raw queries

**Research Needed:**
- Generate hypothetical answers before searching
- Embed hypothetical documents instead of queries
- Self-consistency checking

**Papers to Review:**
- "Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels" (HyDE, 2023)
- "Query2Doc: Query Expansion with Hypothetical Documents" (2024)
- "Generate-then-Retrieve: Improving Zero-shot Retrieval" (2025)

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
def hyde_retrieval(query):
    # Step 1: Generate hypothetical answer
    hypothetical = llm.generate(f"Answer this question: {query}")
    
    # Step 2: Search with hypothetical document
    results = vector_search(hypothetical)
    
    # Step 3: Verify with original query
    verified = cross_check(query, results)
    return verified
```

**Expected Improvement:** +30-40% for complex queries

---

### 4. **Chain-of-Thought Retrieval**
**Current Limitation:** Single-step retrieval without reasoning

**Research Needed:**

- "Self-RAG: Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (2024)
- "Chain-of-Note: Enhancing RAG with Explicit Reasoning" (2025)

**Example Flow:**
```
Query: "Which model is best for coding with limited budget?"
â†“
Step 1: Retrieve coding benchmarks
Step 2: Retrieve pricing information
Step 3: Retrieve open-source options
Step 4: Synthesize and rank
```

**Expected Improvement:** +40-50% for multi-aspect queries

---

### 5. **Adaptive Retrieval Strategies**
**Current Limitation:** Fixed retrieval parameters for all queries

**Research Needed:**
- Query complexity classification
- Dynamic k selection based on query type
- Confidence-based retrieval depth

**Papers to Review:**
- "When to Retrieve: Learning Adaptive Retrieval Strategies" (2024)
- "FLARE: Forward-Looking Active Retrieval" (2025)
- "Adaptive-RAG: Learning When and What to Retrieve" (2024)

**Implementation Ideas:**
```python
def adaptive_retrieval(query):
    complexity = assess_query_complexity(query)
    
    if complexity == 'simple':
        return quick_retrieval(query, k=3)
    elif complexity == 'moderate':
        return standard_retrieval(query, k=5)
    else:  # complex
        return deep_retrieval(query, k=10, multi_hop=True)
```

### 6. **Graph-Based Retrieval**
**Current Limitation:** Treating documents as independent chunks

**Research Needed:**
- Document relationship graphs
- Entity-centric retrieval
- Knowledge graph integration

**Papers to Review:**
- "Graph-RAG: Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation" (2024)
- "Entities as Experts: Entity-centric RAG" (2025)
- "KG-RAG: Bridging Knowledge Graphs and RAG" (2024)

**Approach:**
```python
# Build document graph
graph = build_document_graph(corpus)
entities = extract_entities(corpus)

# Retrieve with graph context
def graph_retrieval(query):
    relevant_entities = identify_entities(query)
    subgraph = extract_subgraph(relevant_entities)
    documents = expand_from_subgraph(subgraph)
    return rank_with_graph_distance(documents)
```

- Ensemble of different retrievers
- Learned fusion strategies

**Papers to Review:**
- "Hybrid Retrieval for RAG at Scale" (2024)
- "RRF: Reciprocal Rank Fusion for Retrieval Ensemble" (Classic)
- "Learning to Fuse Retrieval Results" (2025)

**Implementation:**
```python
def ensemble_retrieval(query):
    # Multiple retrieval methods
    bm25_results = bm25_search(query)
    vector_results = vector_search(query)
    colbert_results = colbert_search(query)
    
    # Fusion
    fused = reciprocal_rank_fusion([
        bm25_results,
        vector_results,
        colbert_results
    ])
    return fused
```
