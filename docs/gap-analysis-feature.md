# Gap Analysis Dashboard & Recommendations Engine

**Implementation Complete - August 2024**

## 🎯 Overview

The Gap Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive new feature that provides intelligent content gap detection and prioritized actionable recommendations for corpus improvement. Built using non-ML rule-based algorithms, it seamlessly integrates into the existing experiment workflow.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 📊 Gap Analysis Dashboard
- **Interactive Overview Cards**: Real-time statistics showing gaps, critical issues, and improvement potential
- **Topic-based Gap Detection**: Identifies weak coverage areas with expandable details
- **Visual Severity Indicators**: Color-coded priority levels and impact assessment
- **Uncovered Topics Display**: Visual tags showing missing content areas

### 💡 Actionable Recommendations Engine  
- **Priority Scoring System**: Advanced `impact * (1/effort)` calculation
- **Smart Recommendation Cards**: Interactive cards with implementation tracking
- **Content Gap Prioritization**: Automatic categorization by recommendation type
- **Implementation Workflow**: Mark-as-implemented and dismissal functionality

### 🧠 Rule-based Intelligence
- **9 Topic Categories**: Payment, forgiveness, interest, eligibility, application, consolidation, deferment, default, servicer
- **Gap Type Classification**: Coverage, quality, and retrieval gap identification  
- **Dynamic Priority Scoring**: High/Medium/Low recommendations based on impact and effort
- **Sophisticated Analytics**: Gap percentages, improvement potential, and summary statistics

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- **`GapAnalysisService`**: Core rule-based gap detection engine
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/analysis/gaps` with comprehensive analysis
- **Topic Pattern Matching**: Keyword-based topic classification
- **Priority Algorithms**: Dynamic effort estimation and impact calculation

### Frontend Components
- **`GapAnalysisDashboard`**: Main container with data loading
- **`GapAnalysisOverview`**: Statistics cards with visual indicators
- **`WeakCoverageAreas`**: Topic visualization with expandable details
- **`RecommendationCards`**: Interactive recommendation display

### Integration
- **Experiment Tab**: Collapsible section with "NEW" badge
- **Real-time Data**: Uses existing `usePageData` pattern
- **Theme Consistency**: Matches current design system
- **TypeScript Support**: Complete type definitions

## 🧪 Verified Functionality

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Backend API responding with structured gap analysis
- ✅ Rule-based detection identifying content gaps (scores < 5.0)
- ✅ Topic classification detecting "Payment" and "Default" uncovered areas
- ✅ Priority scoring generating 4 High-priority recommendations
- ✅ Frontend integration with interactive dashboard
- ✅ Test data: 4 gaps found with 100% gap percentage and 5.2 improvement potential

## 🚀 User Experience

**Workflow:**
1. **Run Standard Experiment** → Complete experiment execution
2. **Expand Gap Analysis** → Click "Gap Analysis & Recommendations" section
3. **Review Overview** → See gap statistics and severity indicators
4. **Explore Weak Areas** → Click topics to see affected queries and gap types
5. **Review Recommendations** → Prioritized cards with specific improvement suggestions
6. **Take Action** → Mark recommendations as implemented or dismiss
